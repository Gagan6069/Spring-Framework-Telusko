Dependency Injection:

It starts with creating object of ApplicationContext (org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext)

Say in Plain Core Java
Example: I have a App.java which is the entry point of the application

I create 2 more classes 
1. Bike.java
2. Car.java

Both have drive() method and have a sysout.
In app.java If I have to use any oh=f the 2 classes I have to create an object
Bike bike = new Bike();		or
Car car = new Car();

Or say I create an Interface (Interface has all the methods as public, and methods dont have bodt)
Vehicle and it has method drive 
In Bike I implement the interface

So now in App.java I dont have to use the Bike or Car object. The left hand part is sorted with the Vehicle interface.
But as Telusko said why even we have to change the right side

You can only create instance of a Class

Dependency Injection can be configured in 3 ways
1. Java based
2. Annotation
3. XML file
